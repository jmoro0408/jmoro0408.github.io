I've had the opportunity to work a lot with Excel recently and, although I always considered myself competent, I have recently discovered some new functions/features that have allowed my efficiency to increase hugely.

These are roughly ranked in what I consider to be the more common/well known to least.

## 1. Data Validation
## 2. AGGREGATE
## 3. FILTER
## 4. INDIRECT
## 5. Camera Function
